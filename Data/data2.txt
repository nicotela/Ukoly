The Kharadron Overlords are masters of the 
skies, fearless duardin aeronauts who prize profit 
above all. They sail the clouds in steel-clad vessels 
armed to the teeth with cannons, bombs and 
bullet-spraying deckguns, matching the raw fury of 
daemons and monsters with devastating firepower. 
These technological wonders are powered by the 
lighter-than-air mineral known as aether-gold – the 
lifeblood of the great Kharadron empire.
The Age of Sigmar appeared to herald a time of 
plenty for the Kharadron sky-ports. The mercantile 
duardin forged prosperous new contracts and 
alliances with the forces of Sigmar the God-King that 
kept a constant stream of gold flooding into their 
coffers. Yet a storm was looming on the horizon. 
Nagash, Supreme Lord of the Undead, unleashed 
the horror of the necroquake, and the tumultuous 
ripples of this catastrophe rocked the Eight Realms. 
Prosperous aether-gold deposits were displaced by 
storms of raw magic, swept into uncharted lands. The 
sky-ports suffered greatly, as hosts of unquiet spirits 
set upon their fleets and cut off precious trade lanes.
However, in disaster there is opportunity. From the 
bustling docks of the Kharadron’s floating cities 
depart gleaming sky-fleets, armed for war and eager 
to seek out precious new streams of aether-gold. 
Ironclad ships of the line lead brave ventures into 
the deadliest corners of the Eight Realms in search 
of precious aether-gold, following by sleek escort 
gunships zipping between the flotilla like pilot 
fish. From the decks of their flagships, Kharadron 
Admirals drive their hearty crews on with promises 
of unlimited wealth and everlasting fame.
